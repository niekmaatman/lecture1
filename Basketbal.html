              These are the original rules of basketball, these rules are made in 1892.
              The original game played under these rules was quite different from the one played today as there was no dribbling,
              dunking, three-pointers. Under here you can see the original rules of basketball:

              <ol>
                <li>The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.</li>
                <li>The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands </li>
                <li>A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it,
                  allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.</li>
                <li>The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it. </li>
                <li>No shouldering, holding, striking, pushing, or tripping in any way of an opponent.
                  The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next basket is made or,
                  if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game. No substitution shall be allowed. </li>
                <li>A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of rules three and four and such described in rule five. </li>
                <li>If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the meantime making a foul).</li>
                <li>A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there (without falling), providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal.
                    If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.</li>
                <li>When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play and played by the first person touching it. In case of dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field.
                  The thrower-in is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on that side.</li>
                <li>The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify people according to Rule 5.</li>
                <li>The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the baskets,
                  with any other duties that are usually performed by a scorekeeper.</li>
                <li>The time shall be two fifteen-minute halves, with five minutes rest between.</li>
                <li>The side making the most points in that time is declared the winner.</li>

              </ol><br>

              When I was 14 years old I started playing basketball, beforehand I was playing tennis but I quitted that and started playing basketball.
              The position that I was in was a center that means that I would stand near the basket. I have played basketball approximately 3 years,
              I quitted because my current team was being separated.  And I didnâ€™t want to play in a other team. After this I started playing tennis again.

              In the Netherlands we do not have a great basketball league, because of this I watched a lot of NBA. That is the basketball league of the USA.
              I have been to a game of the Dutch league, the level of skills was really impressing, but it is nothing compared to the NBA. My favorite NBA team is the Warriors,
              because Stephen curry plays there.
