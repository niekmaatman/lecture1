        <h3>Football rules</h3>
          <p>
            Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest sports in the world and with that; it is also one of the most recognised. The pinnacle of the international game
            comes in the form the Football World Cup.There are also tournament such as the Euro Championships, Copa America and the African Cup of Nations.
            Domestically the strongest leagues come from England (English Premier League), The Netherlands (Eredivisie), Spain (La Liga),Italy (Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the
            world the sport is also known as Soccer.
          </p>

            <h3> Object of the Game </h3>
              <p id="gameObject">
            The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes.
            After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee
            (injury time) will be accordingly.
          </p>
              <br>
            <h3> Players & Equipment</h3>
              <p id="equipment">
            Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players. The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide.
            On each pitch you will have a 6 yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre circle. Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions.
            <br><br>
            Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football. Additionally players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips.
            The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team will have a designated captain.
              </p>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>
           To score the ball must go into your opponents goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder.
           The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.
            </p>

            <h3>Winning the game</h3>
            <p>
            To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents. If the scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart from in cup games where the game can go to extra
            time and even a penalty shootout to decide the winner. Players must use their feet to kick the ball and are prohibited to use their hands apart from goalkeepers who can use any part of their
            body within the 18 yard box (of which more can be found out in the next section).
            </p>

            <h3>A couple of rules of Football</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.</li>
                <li>Each team can have a minimum off 11 players and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.</li>
                <li>The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.</li>
                <li>If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in.
                  If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <h3>The Offside Rule in Football</h3>
              <p>
                Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through to them. The offside area is designed to discourage players from simply hanging around
                the opponents goal waiting for a pass. To be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. If the player is in front of that last defender then he is deemed to
                be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called.
                <br><br>
                A player cannot be caught offside in their own half. The goalkeeper does not count as a defender. If the ball is played backwards and the player is in front of the last defender then he is deemed to be not offside.
