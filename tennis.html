        <h3>Tennis rules</h3>
          <p>
            Tennis is a sport that originated in England around the 19th century and is now played in a host of countries around the world.
            There are four major tournaments known as the majors that include Wimbledon, US Open, French Open and Australian tournament.
          </p>

            <h3> Object of the Game </h3>
              <p id="gameObject">
            The game of tennis played on a rectangular court with a net running across the centre. The aim is to hit the ball over the net
            landing the ball within the margins of the court and in a way that results in your opponent being unable to return the ball.
            You win a point every time your opponent is unable to return the ball within the court.
          </p>
              <br>
            <h3> Players & Equipment</h3>
              <p id="equipment">
            A tennis match can be played by either one player on each side with is called a singles match or two players on each side called a doubles match.
            The rectangular shaped court has a base line (at the back), service areas (two spaces just over the net in which a successful serve must land in)
            and two tram lines down either side. A singles match will mean you use the inner side tram line and a doubles match will mean you use the outer tram line.
            A court can be played on four main surfaces including grass, clay, hard surface and carpet. Each tournament will choose one surface type and stick without throughout.
            All that is required in terms of equipment is a stringed racket each and a tennis ball.
              </p>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>
            You need to score four points to win a game of tennis. The points are known as 15 (1 point), 30 (two points), 40 (three points) and the fourth would result in the winning
            point and the end of that game. If the scores went to 40-40 this would be known as deuce. When a game reaches deuce the player must then win by two clear points.
            </p>

            <h3>Winning the game</h3>
            <p>
            To win the game you must win a certain amount of sets (best of three for womens matches and best of 5 sets for mens matches). Winning a set is simply the first player
            to reach 6 games but have to be clear by at least 2 games. If your opponent wins 5 games you must win the set 7-5. If the set goes to 6-6 then a tie break is played and
            itâ€™s simply the first player to 7 points.
            </p>

            <h3>A couple of rules of Tennis</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>The game starts with a coin toss to determine which player must serve first and which side they want to serve from.</li>
                <li>The server must then serve each point from alternative sides on the base line. At no point must the servers feet move in front of the baseline on the court prior to hitting their serve.</li>
                <li>The receiver may stand where they wish upon receipt of the serve. If the ball is struck without the serve bouncing then the server will receive the point.</li>
                <li>If a player touches the net, distracts his opponent or impedes in anyway then they automatically lose the point.</li>
                <li>The ball can hit any part of the line for the point to be called in, outside the line and the ball is out.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
