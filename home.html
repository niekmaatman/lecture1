          Hello, world! <br>
          My name is Niek Maatman, I am 17 year old, I am from the Netherlands. On this website I will show all my hobbies in live.
          A couple of my hobbies are sports, Every sport has his own pages with there on the rules, and my own experience from this game.
          The hobbies I will talk about are:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Basketbal </li>
            <li> Tennis </li>
            <li> Football</a> </li>
            <li> Vacation</li> <br>
          </ul>
          <p>
          I have played a couple of sports in my live, including basketball, football and tennis. This is why I chose to include these sports in my webpage.
          The first spot I played was football, I played this from 6 years old until 12 years old, at that point I played football and tennis at the same time and had to choose 1 of them.
          I chose tennis and played this until I was 14, after that I started playing basketball for a couple of years. When I was 16 I stopped playing basketball and started playing tennis again.
          I did this because all my friends where playing tennis with each other and I thought it would be fun to join them. My position in football was at first goalie after that I started playing as a center back.
          And my position in basketball was center.
